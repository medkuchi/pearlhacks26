## Inspiration
Inspired by our personal experience with finding roomates, we found the overall process stressful and unstructured. To fix this, we created a website for finding roommates that also calculates compatibility. 

## What it does
After signing in, HeelHome will prompt the user to fill out a survey and provide them with potential rommate matches for the user to swipe through and chat with.

## How we built it
We used HTML, CSS, and JS for the frontend and design for our site. We used Python, Flask and SQLite for data storage and handling. We integrated Gemini to calculate compatibility scores between users. 
## Challenges we ran into
We ran into challenges with Git and merging our branches together as well as with installing Flask and incorporating the Gemini API. We had to learn and watch tutorials to understand the workings of Flask and SQLite to store our data. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of creating an MVP of a roommate finder site and being able to successfuly use Git for collaborative coding.

## What we learned
We learned about backend development, data storage, as well as incorporating Gemini API into our code.

## What's next for HeelHome
We hope to add a user authentification in the login page for a more secure experience as well as 

Future Improvements: 
- UNC SSO authentication for security purposes.
- More features like video call integration so users do not have to share personal information if they don't want to.
- More seamless profile editing.
- Improved UI
- Improving messaging system.
